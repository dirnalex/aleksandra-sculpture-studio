  "about.0.text": "Aleksandra Józefów is a modern sculpture artist who lives and creates in Gdańsk. In her art she uses strong, brutal, resistant materials- like concrete, metal, wood or glass, as well as cllasic marble or granite. Either way- they‘re interpreted in innovative and modern yet at the same time perspicacious, sensitive and thoughtful way."
